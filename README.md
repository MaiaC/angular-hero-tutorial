This is my first time using Angular. It is using Angular's own tutorial which I would NOT recommend. It's very poorly constructed, it gives large chunks of code with minimal and vague explanation of what it does. For example, a function that strings together at east 5 different functions that you've never seen before will be summarized as "this deletes the selected hero from the array and removes it from the view". No mention of how or why or what the hell. Also it's often very unclear where exactly in a file you're suppost to paste these large chunks of code. It gives the file, but does it go inside the class or before or after or inside this bit or where?? 

Anyway, rant over. Was interesting to see what Angular can do but I think it was mostly a waste of frustrating time. Here's the link https://angular.io/tutorial

# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
